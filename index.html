  solely for the purpose of generating a translation.

  <h2>5. Cookies and Tracking</h2>

    technical data and do not identify individual users.

  <h2>6. Push Notifications</h2>
  <p>
    If push notifications are enabled, they are used only for app-related
    information. You can disable notifications at any time in your device settings.

<h2>7. Data Security</h2>
